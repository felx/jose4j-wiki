Note: this is **not** a complete list of changes but rather just attempts to capture some of the more notable milestones and additions. 

=== jose4j-0.3.5 ===
* Added JWE support for AES GCM content encryption (A128GCM, A192GCM & A256GCM)
* Added JWE support for AES GCM key encryption (A128GCMKW, A192GCMKW & A256GCMKW)
* Added JWE support for PBES2 Key Encryption (PBES2-HS256+A128KW, PBES2-HS384+A192KW & PBES2-HS512+A256KW)
* Added JWS support for RSA-PSS signatures (PS256, PS384 & PS512)
* Fixed issues #005 and #006 where certain parameters of EC JWKs and ECDSA signature values were not the full length required by the specifications. 
* Fixed issue #003 where the A256GCM implementation used the wrong algorithm identifier
 

=== jose4j-0.3.4 ===
* JWS/JWE objects now have the ability to whitelist or blacklist the algorithms that will be accepted
* **Breaking change**: by default JsonWebSignature will not accept a Plaintext JWS (i.e. "alg":"none"). Applications can use setAlgorithmConstraints(AlgorithmConstraints.NO_CONSTRAINTS) on JsonWebSignature to indicate that a Plaintext JWS is acceptable. 
* addSeconds(...) on IntDate now takes a long rather than an int

=== jose4j-0.3.3 ===
* JsonWebStructure now has a fromCompactSerialization(...) and get/setPayload(...), which allows for client code to treat JWS/JWE more similarly in some cases
* As a result of the above, JsonWebSignature.getPayload() now checks the signature and throws an exception, if it's not valid. JsonWebSignature.getUnverifiedPayload() can be used to access the payload without the signature check .
* Some defect fixes and clean up

=== jose4j-0.3.2 ===
*JWK toJson now takes a parameter indicating the level of output to produce (i.e. public only, public+symmetric or public+symmetric+private) 
* Improve awareness of handling of algorithm support in the underlying Java runtime

* Add a simple OctJwkGenerator utility for generateing symmetric JWKs
* Added some validation to check that the given key is appropriate for the indicated algorithm and give more helpful error messages when it's not


=== jose4j-0.3.1 ===
update KDF for ECDH-ES key agreement per change in JWA -16 where the AlgorithmID value now has a length prefix  (http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/jose/current/msg03460.html)
