Note: this is **not** a complete list of changes but rather just attempts to capture some of the more notable milestones and additions.  

=== jose4j-0.3.2 ===
*JWK toJson now takes a parameter indicating the level of output to produce (i.e. public only, public+symmetric or public+symmetric+private) 
* Improve awareness of handling of algorithm support in the underlying Java runtime

* Add a simple OctJwkGenerator utility for generateing symmetric JWKs
* Added some validation to check that the given key is appropriate for the indicated algorithm and give more helpful error messages when it's not


=== jose4j-0.3.1 ===
update KDF for ECDH-ES key agreement per change in JWA -16 where the AlgorithmID value now has a length prefix  (http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/jose/current/msg03460.html)
