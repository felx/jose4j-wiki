= Welcome to jose.4.j!=

The jose.4.j library is an Apache 2 licensed open source implementation of JOSE and JWT in Java.


Quick overview of jose.4.j's current support:
* JWS: RSA, Elliptic Curve and HMAC algorithms as well as the unsigned "none" algorithm
* JWE: RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 and RSAES OAEP key encryption, AES key wrapping, direct encryption, and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static key agreement with and without AES key wrapping. AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 content encryption.
* JWK: JWKs with EC and RSA key types including both public and private key support as well as the oct key type for symmetric keys. 
 
== Code Examples ==
jose.4.j is (hopefully) very easy to use and, to help get started, some code examples are provided demonstrating some common things you might want to do with it.

The [[JWS%20Examples|JWS Examples]] show how to easily apply and verify signatures.

The [[JWE%20Examples|JWE Examples]] show up to encrypt and decrypt messages.

== Dependencies ==
The jose.4.j library relies on Codec and Logging from [[http://commons.apache.org/|Apache Commons]] as well as [[https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/|JSON-Simple]]. Attempts have been made to keep the dependencies list as short as possible but it seemed like a bad idea to try and write a base 64 encoder, a logging framework and a JSON parser when so many good implementations of those things already exist. 

The dependencies are also listed in the pom.xml file in the [[https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/src|source]] and Maven should just handle them for you, if you build from source.

Someday I'll figure out how get it into the central maven repo.

== Release Notes == 
These very rough [[Release%20Notes|Release Notes]] capture some of the high level milestones.
